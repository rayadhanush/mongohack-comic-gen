# Comic Strip Generator

This project generates extended scenes from any given story, visualizes them in the style of anime comic strips, and combines them into a unified image. The generation pipeline leverages advanced NLP and image generation models to produce creative outputs. We have a RAG-based model that will enhance the story using a vectorized DB of books and scripts.

## Usage

1. **Extend Story:** Query the system with a prompt like:

```
Take the ending of the Pok√©mon story, extend the story, and write dialogues.
```

2. **Generate Comic Strip:** Visualize the extended scenes as comic strips.

## Project Overview

The Comic Strip Generator utilizes a combination of NLP and deep learning models to extend stories and generate visually appealing anime-style comic strips. The project follows a multi-step process to achieve the following:

1. **Story Extension**: Using a RAG-based model and vectorized database of books and scripts, the system enhances the original story by generating additional scenes.
2. **Image Generation**: The extended scenes are visualized into anime-style comic strips using an image generation model.
3. **Image Compilation**: All generated comic strips are combined into a single, cohesive image for easy viewing.

### Key Components:

1. **Vectorized Database (RAG Model)**:

   - Enhances the story by retrieving related information and generating new scenes.
   - Uses the `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` embedding model for accurate story enhancements.

2. **Text to Image**:

   - The extended story scenes are fed into a Hugging Face model for image generation, using anime-style prompts to create a unique visual representation.

3. **Comic Strip Creation**:
   - The generated comic strips are stitched together and overlaid with the story text in a visually appealing way, resulting in a comic strip-style image.
